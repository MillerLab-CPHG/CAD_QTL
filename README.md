# CAD_QTL

The set of scripts in this repo are intended to generate the necessary input files and run programs to identify expression QTLs for RNA sequencing data using two programs: mixQTL (https://github.com/liangyy/mixqtl/wiki) and a QTLtools-based (https://qtltools.github.io/qtltools/) pipeline to incorporate local ancestry into the model. If you use these scripts for your own work, please cite our manuscript: biorxiv link

For questions regarding scripts or implementation, please email Chani at ch2um at virginia dot edu.
